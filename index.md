## Teamforce Game

Teamforce game is aimed at the next generation MOBA game, focusing more on collaboration than current MOBA games. Players defeat the evil lords within limited time. We expect our game can assign people to have their duty to help each other. 

### Gameplay Overview

- One Evil Lord vs. four Heroes

- Three routes between the Hero base and the Evil Lord base 
- Each side has a tower on each route for defense
- Each side regularly sends out minion troops to attack
- Monsters in the middle of the island for resources

### Networking Overview

- **Mirror Networking** high-level API for multiplayer game in unity
- Low-level socket to build Lobby System
- **Kerberos**-inspired authentication system
- **Azure** to host game servers
- **MongoDB** to save user account information
